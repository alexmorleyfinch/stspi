# STS-PI

This is a python implementation of the [sts-pi robot](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/sts-pi)

There are no docs at the moment, I just uploaded my work.

* Uses a Playstation 3 controller for input.
* It can be run on a Raspberry PI and has an interface for controller connection.
* It controls led lights on the "Explorer Hat" accessory that comes with the STS-PI to indicate on/off states and controller connected/disconnect states.
